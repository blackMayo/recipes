Maria DB Installation:


https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/


Here are the commands to run to install MariaDB on your Ubuntu system:

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xcbcb082a1bb943db
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386] http://mirror2.hs-esslingen.de/mariadb/repo/5.5/ubuntu trusty main'

Once the key is imported and the repository added you can install MariaDB with:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mariadb-client mariadb-server

See Installing MariaDB .deb Files for more information and for instructions on installing MariaDB Galera Cluster.

You can also create a custom MariaDB sources.list file. To do so, after importing the signing key as outlined above, copy and paste the following into a file under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/(we suggest naming the file MariaDB.list or something similar), or add it to the bottom of your /etc/apt/sources.list file.

# MariaDB 5.5 repository list - created 2016-01-19 15:53 UTC

deb [arch=amd64,i386] http://mirror2.hs-esslingen.de/mariadb/repo/5.5/ubuntu trusty main
deb-src http://mirror2.hs-esslingen.de/mariadb/repo/5.5/ubuntu trusty main

-> added above lines to /ets/apt/sources.list

After that....

sudo service mysql stop
sudo mysql_install_db

which responded the following:

Installing MariaDB/MySQL system tables in '/var/lib/mysql' ...

OK

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h ivdev password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
'/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb or the
MySQL manual for more instructions.

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/usr' ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='/var/lib/mysql'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd '/usr/mysql-test' ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

sudo service mysql start

And now let’s secure MariaDB by removing the test databases and anonymous user created by default:
sudo mysql_secure_installation

ou’ll be prompted to enter your current password. Enter the root MariaDB password set during installation:

Enter current password for root (enter for none):

Then, assuming you set a strong root password, go ahead and enter n at the following prompt:

Change the root password? [Y/n] n

Remove anonymous users, Y:

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y

Disallow root logins remotely, Y:

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y

Remove test database and access to it, Y:

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y

And reload privilege tables, Y:

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
